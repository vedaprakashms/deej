# deejCH

deejch is an **open-source hardware volume mixer** for Windows and Linux PCs. It lets you use real-life sliders (like a DJ!) to **seamlessly control the volumes of different apps** (such as your music player, the game you're playing and your voice chat session) without having to stop what you're doing.

This is hardware port of deej, but uses a completely new Lowcost IC CH552G. the entire cost would be less than $5 or ₹500.
